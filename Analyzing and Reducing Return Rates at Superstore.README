Title: Analyzing and Reducing Return Rates at Superstore

Through this Tableau dashboard, I have analyzed return trends to uncover the key factors influencing high return rates. 
By examining product categories, customer behavior, shipping methods, and geographical variations
Finding: Impact of Order Quantity on Return Rates

This analysis reveals a strong correlation between orders where the same Order ID appears more than 8 times on the same date
 and increased return rates. This trend suggests that bulk purchases may be more prone to returns, potentially due to issues related
to shipping, handling. One possible explanation is that larger shipments are
more susceptible to damage during transit, leading to a higher likelihood of returns.
In this analysis we calculate return rate as follows:

Return Rate (%) = (Total Returns / Total Orders) × 100

Best for: Understanding the proportion of orders being returned.

- If you’re focusing on customer behavior, use return rate.
- If you’re concerned about financial losses, track return cost.
- If you’re managing operations & logistics, monitor total return count.
